# Greenwashing Dashboard

## Overview

This prototype dashboard visualizes and categorizes social media posts according to our greenwashing typology. 
It enables users to filter, explore, and analyze messaging trends by companies and platforms. 
Built with Dash (Plotly), this tool shows how we want to integrate embedded content, rich filters, and interactive visualizations for the end-user.

## Features

### Post Feed

- **Post Setup**: 
  - Posts are embedded directly from Junkipedia using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This logic is in `layouts/content.py`, where URLs like `junkipedia.org/posts/{post_id}` are used in embedded iframe components.
- **Label Assignment**: 
  - Each post is tagged with a high-level label: Green, Fossil, Green+Fossil, or Misc. Labels and color coding are handled in `callbacks/content.py`.
- **Subcategory Labels**:
  - If applicable, posts include subcategory classifications. These are derived from the data in `process_data.py`.

### Filters

Defined in `callbacks/filters.py` and configured in `layouts/sidebars.py`:

- **Keyword Search**: A text input allows filtering posts by keywords.
- **Date Range**: DatePickerRange component sets temporal boundaries.
- **View Mode**: Toggle between viewing all posts or comparing labels side-by-side.
- **Companies & Platforms**: Multi-dropdowns populated from the dataset.
- **Subcategories**: Conditional filters appear when relevant.
- **Channels**: Filter by data source or distribution outlet.
- **Message Type**: Select between "All" messages or "Unique" ones (de-duplicated logic handled in `process_data.py`).

### Analytics

Charts are rendered in `util/` modules and displayed via `layouts/content.py`.

- **Post Classification Overview** (`util/plot_overview.py`)
  - Bar graphs show counts by high-level label.
  - Subcategory breakdowns for Green and Fossil.
  - Uniform y-axis scaling is enforced for visual consistency.

- **Greenwashing Score** (`util/plot_greenwashing_score.py`)
  - Score = (% Green Posts) / (% Green CAPEX).
  - Toggle options: raw (linear), raw (log), normalized (linear).
  - CAPEX data comes from `low_carbon_ratios.csv`.

- **Green Share of Climate-Relevant Posts** (`util/plot_green_share.py`)
  - Line graph tracks the fraction of climate-oriented posts that exhibit Green messaging over time.

Analytics filters mirror the post feedâ€™s, implemented via callbacks in `callbacks/filters.py`.

### About
