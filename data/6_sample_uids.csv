Our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods, shared with Dan Yergin today at CERAWeek by IHS Markit how we’re working to produce critical energy and products to meet society’s evolving needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. “We have set a target of net zero in the Permian by 2030. And one of the points of doing that was to demonstrate to the world we can do both. The Permian is one of our fastest-growing production operations, and we’re reducing emissions. Just this year, we’ve reached zero routine flaring and we’re on track to get a net-zero position in the Permian by 2030 while we grow production to 1 million barrels per day.” We view success as working to solve the “and” equation, one in which we can produce the energy and products society needs – and – be a leader in reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions and those from others.

We’re starting with the technologies that match our strengths -- carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. We have agreements in place to transport and store up to 5 million metric tons of CO₂ a year for three of our customers along the U.S. Gulf Coast. That’s equivalent to replacing approximately 2 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles, which is roughly equal to the total number of EVs on US roads today. We’re also planning to build the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas, at planned start up. We plan to invest $17 billion through 2027 on lower-emission initiatives. Matt shared the stage with Takajiro “Tak” Ishikawa, president and CEO of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) America. ExxonMobil and MHI have a strategic alliance on #carboncapture technology. They discussed the value of working with start-ups on cutting-edge technology, the need for creative solutions in countries that lack geologic formations for CO₂ storage, and the growing demand from industries seeking help to reduce their emissions.

  Near Houston, we’re planning to build the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen facility at our integrated Baytown complex. More than 98% of the associated CO₂ produced by the facility, or around 7 million metric tons per year, is expected to be captured and permanently stored. 
  
 

  We’ve also agreed to transport and store CO₂ to reduce emissions from Linde plc’s new hydrogen facility in Beaumont, TX; CF Industries’ manufacturing site in Donaldsonville, LA; and Nucor ’s direct reduced iron facility in Convent, LA. 
  
 

  With these three agreements, the total CO₂ we’ve agreed to transport and store for third-party customers has reached 5 million metric tons per year.

  They discussed the value of working with start-ups on cutting-edge technology, the need for creative solutions in countries that lack geologic formations for CO₂ storage, and the growing demand from industries seeking help to reduce their emissions.

  In her address to delegates, our Chairperson and Managing Director, Tera Shandro, mapped out the future of Papua New Guinea’s resource opportunities and reinforced the growing importance of #LNG towards the security of supply, and the energy transition.
  
  “As the world’s population increases, so too does its need for affordable, secure, and reliable energy, with improved emissions intensity compared to legacy sources,” Ms Shandro said.
  
  “Natural gas, and particularly LNG, will play a vital role in meeting this demand and support climate goals, as it emits up to 60 percent fewer greenhouse gases and significantly fewer air pollutants when compared with traditional energy sources. With 40 percent of the world’s electricity still being generated by coal, there are many opportunities for meaningful emissions reductions by making the switch to natural gas, and that’s why it sits at the center of our strategy.
  
  “From ExxonMobil’s perspective, Asia Pacific countries are expected to be a core natural gas customer for decades to come and will continue turning to Papua New Guinea thanks to its proximity, high quality resources and efficient and reliable operating facilities.
  
  “#PNGLNG is already leading the world in energy emissions intensity and reliability, but as we look to our latest investment, the Papua LNG Project alongside TotalEnergies, its proposed plans are an example of how new technology applied to proven processes, such as electric trains, can help provide affordable energy in a lower-carbon world.

  “It gives us an opportunity to work to world class standards in the field of NDT and enhance our learnings by working in collaboration with other engineers and technicians,” shared Nares Engineering Limited’s (NEL) Integrity Engineer (Mechanical Engineer), Ezekiel Dau. 
  
 

  Based at the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant, in Hela Province, supporting asset integrity and quality assurance of the facility, Ezekiel credits NEL for giving him the opportunity to work in an environment which is new and highly complex in-terms of technology and system with regard to LNG production.
  
 

  “This has continually improved our skills technically and learnings when working in a multi-cultural setting like this and amongst people who are highly skilled and qualified in their respective fields.
  
 

  “Each day, we start off with a safety meeting with the Maintenance team, then our own meeting with our ExxonMobil Integrity Supervisors for daily tasks. 
  
 

  “Afterwards, we prepare our work scope for the day, check our tools for calibration and for any faults, acquire gas testers for our equipment and tools for jobs to be completed in the live production plant”
  
 

  Ezekiel enjoys utilising different NDT techniques to locate defects and prevent failures from occurring that can be catastrophic in terms of production loss, environment, and safety to clients. 
  
 

  “One of my job highlights has been completing an NDT inspection for a client and locating cracking defects on the weld of a boiler tube. The boiler was not operating at a certain pressure that was required due to cracks causing leaks.
  
 

  “Ten years from now, God willing, I will make the most of every opportunity that comes my way, enhancing each technique in NDT, Condition Monitoring & Reliability Engineering,” concluded Ezekiel. #PNGpartnership #PNGLNG",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

My advice to any aspiring young person out there is… if an opportunity presents itself to you, take it! Do not hold yourself back and wonder whether you are qualified for it or not; just give your best and you will be surprised that you’re enjoying it,” shared Priscilla Peter, Safety Specialist at ExxonMobil PNG (EMPNG). 
  
 

  Based at ExxonMobil Haus in Port Moresby, Priscilla coordinates ExxonMobil Haus safety programs and facilitate the Safety Committee activities.
  
 

  “I support EMPNG worksites by performing regular analysis of their safety data and drive the roll-out of our Safe Choice program in-country. I also serve as the Ergonomics Lead Site Administrator, leading a team of 42 Ergo contacts spread across the business. Another key component of my role is the oversight of Vector Control for our worksites. Vector Control activities are associated with the eradication or limitation of disease carrying insects or animals such as mosquitoes (malaria).” 
  
 

  In her role, Priscilla has the opportunity to engage with different professionals from various backgrounds.
  
 

  “I am amazed at how personal safety plays a vital role in every aspect of the jobs we do, whether it be sitting in the office or working out in the field. With the extensive safety data collection that EMPNG has, we are able to pick up trends and identify areas where accidents and incidents are prone to happen to mitigate hazards and ensure ‘Nobody Gets Hurt’. The highlight for me was providing safety support to the rate reduction activities at the LNG Plant this year. Rate reduction is a partial shutdown so that maintenance can be done on machines that are offline. It was a great feeling to be part of that effort.

  Peter re-joins the PNG LNG Project having been part of the of the early construction phase in 2009/2010. Returning to Papua New Guinea, Peter and his wife Taryn bring fond memories of their time here, from the wonderful people to the beautiful country and rich culture.  
  
 

  Reflecting on his return, Peter said “over the past several years I’ve watched ExxonMobil PNG from afar and have been amazed at not only what has been achieved but how the team has achieved it. 
  
 

  “While it is hard to narrow down the highlights, seeing the initial project commissioning and production ramp up well ahead of schedule, to proudly building a strong Papua New Guinean workforce, to developing local suppliers and supporting landowner companies, to supporting the communities in which we operate, to navigating the challenges of COVID-19, and all of this while continuing to improve ExxonMobil PNG’s safety and environmental performance. 
  
 

  “These are truly amazing achievements and I am proud and humbled to be taking over from Andrew Barry to lead this incredible and high performing team. I look forward to continuing to share the #PNGLNG story and the critical importance of National Content in everything we do.”

1189463634850768,"Snakes are an important part of Papua New Guinea’s biodiversity and play a crucial role in balancing the ecosystem. We celebrated #worldenvironmentday on Saturday 5 June by catching up with #PNGLNG resident snake handler Owen Paiva, who safely removes snakes from the LNG Plant (LNGP) and relocates them to similar environments away from people and local communities.
  
  “The environment we live in always has a balance in place where living things play specific roles and depend on each other – this is ecology. When a component of that balance is affected, it can cause a shift to all that rely on it,” shared Owen. 
  
  Since 2004, Owen has been involved in snakebite research and safely handling venomous snakes. Before joining International SOS (ISOS) and working at the LNG Plant, he managed a NGO-based snakebite and venom research laboratory – the Charles Campbell Toxinology Centre (CCTC). 
  
  “Many snakes feed on rodents, lizards and even other snakes, while other snakes feed on frogs, and some on aquatic animals. Some birds like eagles, kookaburras, and owls depend on snakes for their diet. If the number of snakes decreases in an environment then the population of rodents and lizards may increase, and birds and other species that depend on snakes as food may also suffer. Snakes have their part to play in maintaining this environmental balance.”
  
  Since joining ISOS last year and working at LNGP, Owen credits the zero number of snakebite incidents to ExxonMobil PNG’s strong safety protocols which are similar to those he practiced at CCTC – something Owen believes has contributed to never being bitten by a venomous snake in 15 years. 
  
  Communities neighbouring LNGP are home to 12 different species of snakes including Papuan taipan, whipsnakes, carpet pythons, amethystine pythons, olive pythons, slatey grey snakes, common tree snakes, brown tree snakes, mangrove snakes, blind snakes and sea kraits. 
  
  At ExxonMobil PNG we take protecting the environment very seriously. We remain committed to supporting a range of environmental initiatives and educating communities to help preserve Papua New Guinea’s natural wonders for generations to come. #PNGpartnership",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
